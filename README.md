## How to use 
1. Download [Rainmeter](https://rainmeter.net/).
2. Download the rmskin file at the [Release](https://github.com/BjornLuG/Rainmeter-Tron-Suite/releases/tag/v1.0) section.
3. Load the rmskin to install the skins. 
4. Load the skins in the *Tron* folder or load the *Tron* layout. *voila~*

## Notes
- Most of the suite functions can be found by right-clicking the *Theme.ini* skin.
- Make sure to check the *Variables.inc* file to adjust its setting, especially the *ScreenHeight* option
- The suite uses a skin to overlay the desktop wallpaper to control the wallpaper tinting.
- The suite is built on my 1366x768 monitor, you may have to adjust the position manually.
- The clock and background has visualizer variants postfixed *'Vis'*. Load the correct variant to minimize unwanted CPU usage.
- The background skin does not cover the entire screen because Windows will make it appear over the taskbar. The image is cropped 1px left and right each in the skin so that it's not fullscreen and the taskbar will function normally. Also, make sure its X position is set to 1.
